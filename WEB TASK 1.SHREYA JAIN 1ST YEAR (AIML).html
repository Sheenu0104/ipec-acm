    <h1><u>WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></h1>
    <p><b><i>Web development</i></b> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet.
         Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
         <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.<br> Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills</p>
         <p>Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer :front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.<strong> Front-end developers</strong> are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while<strong> back-end developers</strong> deal with the servers.<br> Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
